* Building

While this should work with any ANSI compatible Common Lisp implementation,
only SBCL is currently supported for making an executable.  SBCL is available
as a package for most GNU/Linux distributions, or alternatively from the
website: http://www.sbcl.org/

With SBCL installed build the lasso program by running:

./build.sh

If SBCL is not in your path, give its absolute path as follows:

SBCL=/path/to/sbcl ./build.sh

If you choose to use a binary from the SBCL website then you would give the
name of the run script:

SBCL=/path/to/sbcl/run-sbcl.sh

* Running

Now build a tree from the example dataset and write it (in Newick format) to
output:

./lasso paradoxus-part.csv > output

The program can also print in a unicode text format with option -p, or in TikZ
format for LaTeX by options -t or -T (the latter producing a polar tree).

To use the TikZ output, you require the TikZ package for LaTeX (included by
default in most distributions).  Write the TikZ output into a file and include
it in a LaTeX document.  Below is an example of including a normal tree and a
polar tree.

\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article}

\usepackage{tikz}

\usetikzlibrary{calc}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=50,yscale=0.5]
  \input{tree.tex}
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=5]
  \input{tree-polar.tex}
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}

Note the scale parameters for tikzpicture.  You will need to play around with
these to make the picture look nice in your document.  If you need to change
the size of the labels, use scalefont, e.g.:

{\scalefont{0.3}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=22]
  \input{tree-polar.tex}
\end{tikzpicture}
}
