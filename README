While this should work with any ANSI compatible Common Lisp implementation,
only SBCL is currently supported for making an executable.  SBCL is available
as a package for most GNU/Linux distributions, or alternatively from the
website: http://www.sbcl.org/

With SBCL installed build the lasso program by running:

./build.sh

Now build a tree from the example dataset and write it (in Newick format) to
output:

./lasso paradoxus-part.csv > output

The program can also print in a unicode text format with option -p, or in TikZ
format for LaTeX by options -t or -T (the latter producing a polar tree).
